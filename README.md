EDA and prediction of the social media platform Reddit's scores (Upvotes - Downvotes). 
This research project, delves into the dynamic world of social media analytics, focusing on Reddit, a hub of diverse user-generated content. We embarked on a data-driven journey to predict Reddit submission scores, employing a rich dataset of 132,303 entries. Utilizing advanced machine learning models like linear regression, random forest, XGBoost, and support vector regression (SVR), we analyzed post metadata and conducted sentiment analysis on post titles. Our comprehensive study not only offers a predictive framework for assessing post popularity but also sheds light on the collective behavior of Reddit users, presenting valuable insights for content creators and marketers aiming to enhance their engagement on the platform.
